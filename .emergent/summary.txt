The AI engineer has transformed the GRRAS Solutions Training Institute's website from an MVP to a robust, CMS-driven platform. Initial efforts focused on critical fixes, including Railway deployment, login, widget relocation, and an extensive overhaul of PDF generation and lead deletion. A significant portion of the work revolved around implementing a comprehensive course organization strategy, introducing categories and learning paths. This involved iterative development, debugging frontend caching, addressing backend data inconsistencies, and refining UI components. Deployment challenges, particularly regarding environment variables and Docker/Nixpacks configuration on Railway, were encountered and resolved. The work is currently focused on perfecting the display and categorization of all course types (certifications, degree programs, programming) within the new Classic Certification Academy layout.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the Classic Certification Academy Layout for the courses display. The user reported that while certification courses were being shown, other crucial course types like degree programs and programming courses were missing from the new . The user also noted issues with the categorization within the Certifications tab itself.

To address this, the AI engineer has been making several targeted edits to :
1.  **Ensuring all course types are included**: Modifying the logic to ensure  and  courses are properly fetched and displayed alongside certifications.
2.  **Refining Categorization Logic**: Adjusting the internal logic to correctly group courses by vendor (Red Hat, AWS, Kubernetes) and other relevant categories, and ensuring they appear under the right tabs.
3.  **Updating Level Determination**: Enhancing the logic to correctly assign and display Foundation, Professional, and Expert levels for all courses, especially for the newly integrated types.
4.  **Fixing Stats Display**: Adjusting the statistics displayed on the page to accurately reflect counts across all categories.
5.  **Standardizing Styling**: Correcting Tailwind CSS classes for course cards and level sections to ensure consistent and professional visual presentation.

The very last action taken was an edit to fix the level section color classes within . This indicates the work is in the final stages of UI/UX refinement for the course display.
