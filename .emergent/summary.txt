The trajectory details the iterative development and deployment of the GRRAS Solutions Training Institute website. Initially, the AI engineer established an MVP with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, implementing core features like multi-page navigation, lead capture, and an admin panel. A significant pivot occurred with the user's demand for a fully CMS-driven system, leading to extensive backend and frontend overhauls for dynamic content management.

The project then entered a challenging phase focused on Railway deployment, encountering issues with Node.js version compatibility, service detection, and crucial data persistence across deployments. Multiple attempts were made to fix CMS data overwriting, eventually leading to a switch to MongoDB Atlas for state persistence. Concurrently, the AI addressed numerous frontend and backend bugs related to content display, authentication, PDF generation, and UI/UX.

The current state is characterized by several persistent, interconnected issues, primarily related to the robustness of the CMS (saving/persistence), comprehensive course schema binding, and frontend navigation/display bugs. The AI has just received a consolidated, detailed list of all outstanding problems and is preparing a single, comprehensive implementation plan to resolve them.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a professional website for GRRAS Solutions Training Institute. Initial requirements included a multi-page structure (Home, About, Courses, Contact), a lead capture system with PDF syllabus downloads, an admin panel for lead management, GRRAS branding, a contact page map, responsive design, and SEO.

The project evolved into a fully CMS-driven system. Key enhancements included a dynamic hero banner, a secure admin content panel () with full CRUD, reorder, visibility toggle, draft/publish workflow, version history, media library, and API endpoints for content management. All website content (text, fees, duration, tools, headlines, stats, menu items) was to be editable via CMS, with frontend pages rendering data exclusively from it, and PDF generation using live CMS data. Persistence of CMS edits across deployments became a critical requirement.

Deployment on Railway was also explicitly requested, leading to specific configurations for backend and frontend services, environment variables, and MongoDB Atlas integration for persistent storage. Recent specific feature requests include: fully binding all course fields and fees/duration everywhere, adding a Cyber Security course with rich details, fixing header Courses dropdown clickability, binding Contact page and Footer details from CMS settings, improving logo visibility, ensuring CMS data persistence after GitHub deploys, and updating the production domain to .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had focused heavily on resolving critical deployment and persistence issues with Railway. After multiple failed attempts to ensure CMS changes (like course fees or tools) survived GitHub deployments using local file-based persistent storage, the strategy pivoted to integrating MongoDB Atlas. The AI successfully configured the backend to use MongoDB for both CMS content and leads, confirming MongoDB connection and basic persistence via backend tests (Chat Message 538).

However, the user immediately reported (Chat Message 539) that my admin page not working fine not able to save anything taking too much time i thought mongo db not working fine can you pls cross check it? getting this error Failed to save content. Please try again. This indicates that while MongoDB might be connected, the save functionality through the admin panel is still broken or excessively slow, leading to the Failed to save content error, effectively negating the persistence solution from the user's perspective.

Following this, the user provided a comprehensive list of all remaining issues (Chat Message 542), including persistence, course schema expansion, the new Cyber Security course, fees propagation, dropdown navigation bugs, contact settings binding, logo visibility, and the production domain. The AI's last action (Chat Message 543) was to acknowledge this complete list and state its intention to address all items systematically in a single, comprehensive implementation pass.
