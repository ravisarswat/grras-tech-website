The trajectory details the development of the GRRAS Solutions Training Institute website. Initially, the AI engineer established a full-stack MVP and then rapidly evolved it into a CMS-driven system using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB Atlas. A major focus was on robust content management, including an expanded course schema and dynamic UI rendering.

Significant challenges arose with Railway deployment, primarily related to dependency management (yarn vs. npm), conflicting build configurations (monorepo detection), and persistent data synchronization between local and production MongoDB instances. The AI iteratively addressed these, refining , , and other deployment-related files, often cleaning up redundant or conflicting configurations.

Beyond deployment, the AI implemented comprehensive CMS features: a new , dynamic header/footer, and an . It also performed extensive UI/UX improvements on course detail pages. The most recent efforts involved resolving a specific login issue for the  page and identifying that the  was incorrectly placed on the homepage, which is the immediate task at hand.

<product_requirements>
The GRRAS Solutions Training Institute requires a professional, multi-page website with a lead capture system, PDF syllabus downloads, an admin panel for lead management and content, GRRAS branding, and responsive design with SEO. The project advanced to a fully CMS-driven system, enabling dynamic content management (hero banner, course details, settings, footer, contact info) via a secure admin panel () with CRUD, reordering, visibility toggles, and version history. Content should be editable through the CMS, and all frontend pages must render exclusively from this data, with PDF generation reflecting live CMS content. A critical requirement was ensuring CMS data persistence across Railway deployments. Recent specific tasks included fully binding all course fields, adding a Cyber Security course, fixing the header Courses dropdown, binding Contact page and Footer details from CMS, improving logo visibility, ensuring CMS data persistence after GitHub deploys, updating the production domain to , and an Eligibility Widget to dynamically display course eligibility from the CMS.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a series of critical fixes addressing persistent Railway deployment failures, which involved a drastic cleanup of conflicting build configuration files and a re-consolidation of , , and  at the root level to simplify the build process for Railway. This was concluded with the expectation that the next GitHub commit would lead to a successful deployment.

Following this, the user reported that the  login was failing while  worked with the password . The AI successfully identified and fixed this, rewriting  to use the same shared authentication logic and token as , ensuring consistent login behavior.

The trajectory then shows the AI identifying an unstated issue: the Check Your Eligibility widget, which was recently created and integrated, was incorrectly placed on the  page instead of the  page. The AI's last action was to begin locating the widget's current placement in  to initiate its relocation.
