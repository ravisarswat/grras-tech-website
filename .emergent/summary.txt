The AI engineer's work began by addressing mobile responsiveness and UI/UX issues. Initial efforts focused on enhancing the  mobile menu, replacing emojis with professional logos, and adding animations. A key learning involved overcoming caching issues in a production build, necessitating explicit frontend rebuilds for changes to take effect. Subsequent tasks systematically tackled user feedback, including removing specific items (Blog, Our Technology Partners) from the mobile menu, ensuring clickable footer courses, and resolving various mobile scrolling and menu expansion problems. The  page received a comprehensive mobile redesign to fix alignment. A significant feature addition was the dynamic homepage hero slider, which was later improved by replacing static images with informative, glass-morphism styled data cards. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer identifying an oversized hero slider on MacBook Pro and planning its optimization.

The GRRAS Solutions Training Institute requires a professional, responsive, and SEO-friendly website with lead capture, PDF syllabus downloads, and a comprehensive CMS admin panel. Core functionalities include dynamic content management for courses (categories, learning paths, certification data like AWS, Red Hat, CKA/CKS), a fully dynamic blog system with professional imagery, and a functional newsletter subscription. Recent focus has been on extensive mobile responsiveness: revamping the footer, enhancing the header's mobile menu with clickable company logos linked to courses, and removing specific menu items (Blog, Technology Partners). Scrolling issues, menu expansion behaviors, and footer link clickability have been addressed. The Learning Path detail page's mobile curriculum alignment was also fixed. A key feature added is a dynamic homepage hero slider showcasing courses with engaging, informative data cards replacing previous images. Ongoing refinements involve social media link updates, footer logo removal, and resolving spacing for homepage sections and header navigation tabs.

- Optimize the size of the homepage hero slider for MacBook Pro, as it currently appears too large and occupies excessive screen space.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the homepage's hero slider. The user reported that the slider's size appeared too large on a MacBook Pro, causing content to feel cramped and occupying excessive screen space. The AI engineer initiated an investigation by navigating to the homepage and taking a screenshot (Chat Message 301). The visual inspection confirmed the user's observation: the slider, set with a  of 700px, was indeed occupying approximately 78% of the screen height on a standard laptop viewport (MacBook Pro equivalent), leading to a visually dominant and potentially overwhelming experience. The AI engineer acknowledged the identified issue and, at the conclusion of the trajectory, stated the intent to optimize the slider's size for better proportions. No code changes have been committed for this specific issue yet, but the problem has been thoroughly identified and understood.
