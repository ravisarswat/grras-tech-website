The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the GRRAS Solutions Training Institute's website, with an iterative approach to improving mobile responsiveness and UI/UX. The initial tasks addressed general mobile menu issues and expanded to fixing specific elements like clickable footer links and mobile scrolling. A significant feature addition was the dynamic homepage hero slider, which evolved from showing images to data cards. Much of the trajectory involved meticulous debugging and refinement of this hero slider and the Check Your Eligibility widget on the Admissions page. Challenges included persistent UI issues, browser caching problems, and ensuring exact compliance with user-specified layouts and logo requirements. The AI engineer consistently used screenshots for validation and adopted a systematic approach to resolve alignment, scaling, and spacing inconsistencies across various devices. The work concluded with an identified vertical alignment issue on specific hero slides.

The GRRAS Solutions Training Institute requires a professional, responsive, SEO-friendly website featuring lead capture, PDF syllabus downloads, and a comprehensive CMS admin panel. Key functionalities include dynamic content management for courses (categories, learning paths, certifications), a fully dynamic blog, and newsletter subscription. Recent efforts focused on extensive mobile responsiveness for the footer, header (with clickable company logos, specific menu item removal), and resolving scrolling/menu expansion issues. The Learning Path detail page's mobile curriculum alignment was fixed. A dynamic homepage hero slider was implemented, showcasing courses via informative data cards. Ongoing tasks involved social media updates, footer logo removal, and resolving spacing/alignment for homepage sections and header navigation. Critical user feedback often led to detailed iterative fixes for the hero slider's layout, icon scaling, content alignment, and carousel controls across all screen sizes (mobile, laptop, desktop). The Check Your Eligibility widget on the Admissions page also required significant debugging due to persistent loading issues and URL parameter handling. The goal is a production-ready, visually consistent, and highly responsive user experience.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback regarding the homepage hero slider. The user reported that the RedHat and Degree slides are थोड़ा नीचे जा रहे हैं (slightly downwards). This indicates a vertical alignment issue within these specific slides. The AI engineer acknowledged this, stating, मैं देख रहा हूं कि RedHat और Degree slides थोड़ा नीचे जा रहे हैं। मैं इसे तुरंत fix करता हूं by ensuring proper vertical alignment. No code changes were made for this specific issue at the very end of the trajectory, but the problem has been identified. The preceding work involved a series of intricate fixes for the hero slider, including ensuring original brand logos (Red Hat, AWS, DevOps) were correctly displayed, managing width and spacing, and ensuring mobile responsiveness.
