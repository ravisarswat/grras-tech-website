The trajectory details a dynamic and iterative development process, starting with significant bug fixes and feature enhancements to an existing admin panel, then pivoting to a complete static site conversion due to persistent issues. Initially, the AI engineer tackled complex React state management, event propagation, and data persistence problems in the  and  components. This involved resolving sync verification failed errors, fixing broken delete functionalities, and implementing a robust slug synchronization mechanism. Critical fixes included addressing  function inaccuracies and refining  logic. A major UI/UX overhaul of the  transformed the admin experience. However, repeated user frustrations with the admin panel's category slug update and delete issues, despite extensive debugging and multiple fixes, led to the strategic decision to revert to a static website. The AI engineer then successfully converted the dynamic application to a static one, extracting production data, removing admin routes, and re-architecting frontend components to use local static data, while maintaining the original design and features. A subsequent blank page error post-deployment was resolved by correctly restoring and configuring the  with static data. The final stage involved populating all categories with detailed course data.

The GRRAS Solutions Training Institute sought a professional, responsive, and SEO-friendly website with a robust CMS for dynamic management of categories, courses, learning paths, and blogs. Initial core requirements included a branded header, dynamic hero slider, full responsiveness, and a critical Category System Overhaul for CMS-driven CRUD operations, multi-category course assignments, and elimination of hardcoded elements. Lead capture and PDF syllabus downloads were also essential.

**Current Implementation (Static Website):** Following challenges with the dynamic CMS, the application has been transformed into a fully static website. It retains the original professional design, GRRAS-specific orange branding, and responsive layout across Home, About, Courses, Blog, and Contact pages. All content, including categories, courses, and blog posts, is now hardcoded from the *last known production data*, eliminating backend and admin panel complexities. The website dynamically displays categories with logos, intelligent course cards, and accurate course counts, leveraging static data for stability and performance. The contact form and other frontend features remain functional.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   ****:
    -   Summary: Defines global routes and application structure.
    -   Changes: Admin routes (, ) were completely removed to convert to a static site. The  was re-integrated and configured to use static data to resolve blank page issues.
-   ****:
    -   Summary: Manages global content state for the application.
    -   Changes: Modified to load content from static data files (, , ) instead of making API calls to the backend. This was crucial for the static site conversion and resolving blank page errors.
-   ****:
    -   Summary: Displays the main course catalog.
    -   Changes: Refactored to import and use static  and  data instead of fetching from the backend API. Removed  and related API call logic. Filtering logic was adjusted to handle  property correctly ().
-   ****:
    -   Summary: The landing page, displaying featured content and statistics.
    -   Changes: Updated to consume static categories and courses data, replacing dynamic content fetching.
-   ****:
    -   Summary: Displays blog posts and categories.
    -   Changes: Converted to use static blog data, replacing API calls. The  function was replaced with , and external API references (like  for newsletter) were removed.

<pending_tasks>
All explicit tasks requested by the user during this trajectory (e.g., admin panel fixes, slug sync, static website conversion, populating all course data) have been completed. The last user request was to populate all categories with course data, which has been done.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the comprehensive population of all categories with their respective courses within the static  data file. This involved:

1.  **Extracting Data**: Identifying existing course and category data from the previous state of the application (likely a combination of what was in the dynamic database and user requests).
2.  **Structuring Data**: Adding detailed course entries for categories like DevOps Engineering, Red Hat Technologies (RHCSA, RHCE, DO188, DO280), AWS Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Data Science & AI, Programming & Development, and Cyber Security.
3.  **Enhancing Course Details**: Ensuring each course entry included essential details such as title, slug, description, pricing, duration, level, mode, certification status, tools, learning outcomes, career roles, and their assignment to the correct category.
4.  **Verifying Display**: Confirming that the static data would correctly update the course counts displayed on category cards and ensure that category pages would list the assigned courses accurately, reflecting a total of 19 professional courses across all major IT domains.

The application is now a fully functional, visually consistent static website with a complete and detailed course catalog.
