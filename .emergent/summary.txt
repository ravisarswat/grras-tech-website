The AI engineer successfully transformed an MVP into a CMS-driven application, overcoming significant Railway deployment issues involving conflicting build configurations and dependency management. Initial tasks included fixing login for , relocating the , and implementing CMS control for homepage content. A major focus was on fixing and enhancing the PDF generation system, which required multiple iterations to address frontend endpoint mismatches, persistent browser caching, backend null-safety, proper ReportLab styling, logo integration, and character encoding. Concurrently, full lead deletion functionality (single and bulk) was added to the admin panel. The current work is focused on a strategic overhaul of course organization, introducing categories and learning paths, with a detailed plan for CMS and frontend enhancements and a Railway staging environment.

<product_requirements>
The GRRAS Solutions Training Institute requires a professional, multi-page, responsive, SEO-friendly website with a lead capture system, PDF syllabus downloads, and a CMS admin panel for managing content, leads, and settings. Key features include dynamic content for hero banners, courses, footer, and contact information, with CRUD operations, reordering, visibility toggles, and version history.
Recent explicit requests included:
- Relocate and fix the Check Your Eligibility widget to , ensuring it displays course eligibility and handles missing data gracefully.
- Fix the Send Us a Message contact form to save user queries to the database.
- Make Popular Courses on the homepage CMS-editable (title, subtitle, auto/manual selection, max items).
- Provide guidance for updating the frontend domain to .
- Fix and enhance PDF generation: ensure backend reliability (null safety, in-memory, proper response headers, 422 errors instead of 500s), and significantly improve PDF quality (logo, headers/footers, alignment, no duplicates, correct symbols/encoding).
- Add individual and bulk lead deletion functionality to the admin panel.
- Implement a comprehensive course organization strategy for numerous certification courses, including categories and learning paths, with a market-proven, mobile-first UX. This involves extensive CMS and frontend enhancements and a dedicated Railway staging environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed a series of critical fixes and enhancements, bringing the GRRAS website to a robust, CMS-driven state. The most recent completed work involved comprehensively fixing and enhancing the PDF generation system and implementing full lead deletion functionality in the admin panel.

Specifically:
- **PDF Generation**: The AI engineer successfully resolved all remaining PDF quality issues. The system now produces industry-standard, professional course syllabi with full GRRAS branding, including a proper logo and professional headers/footers on every page. Duplicate content has been eliminated, all character encoding issues (e.g., rupee symbol, C++ text) are resolved, and the layout is clean, readable, and properly formatted using dynamic CMS data. Backend tests confirmed all specified courses (DevOps, C/C++/DSA, Cyber Security) generate high-quality PDFs without errors. This was an iterative process, debugging persistent frontend caching issues and meticulously refining the ReportLab implementation in .
- **Lead Deletion**: Both individual and bulk lead deletion functionality were fully implemented in the admin panel. This included adding backend API endpoints in  and enhancing  with selection checkboxes, a Select All feature, individual delete buttons, a Delete Selected bulk button, and a confirmation modal. The bulk delete frontend request format was also corrected.

The user then shifted focus, asking for a strategy to best display numerous certification courses. The AI proposed a Hybrid Approach (Progressive Disclosure) with categories and learning paths, detailing a comprehensive implementation plan involving CMS schema updates, new frontend pages, search/filtering, and mobile optimization. The user confirmed this plan and the AI engineer has just started implementing **Phase 1: CMS Foundation**, by modifying  to add advanced course organization features, specifically for course categories and learning paths.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to add course discovery and search configuration to the home page, continuing the implementation of the course organization strategy.
