The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of debugging, refactoring, and implementing a fully CMS-driven category and course management system for the GRRAS website. The trajectory began with UI/UX fixes (hero slider alignment, header branding, mobile menu bug). A major focus quickly shifted to implementing dynamic categories, which revealed persistent backend data synchronization issues between local development and the production MongoDB.

Key challenges included  caching old data, database environment mismatches (local  vs.  vs. production Railway DB), and widespread hardcoding of categories within various frontend components. The engineer attempted multiple fixes, including migration scripts and explicit  refreshes. Frontend build and runtime errors (AuthContext, ) also arose. User frustration escalated due to perceived lack of progress and broken functionality, leading to several full repository resets and a crucial pivot towards a complete rewrite of core frontend components (, , , ) to eliminate all hardcoding and ensure a truly dynamic, production-ready system. The final state features a fully dynamic CMS, robust admin panel, and consistent data flow from the production database.

<product_requirements>
The GRRAS Solutions Training Institute requires a professional, responsive, and SEO-friendly website with a robust CMS. Key requirements included:
1.  **Dynamic Content Management:** Fully CMS-driven categories, courses, learning paths, and a dynamic blog.
2.  **User Interface (UI/UX) & Responsiveness:**
    *   Professional, high-resolution header branding (GRRAS [logo] Solutions, Training Institute text removed, Solutions below logo).
    *   Dynamic homepage hero slider with correct vertical alignment and no mobile navigation overlap.
    *   Responsive design across all pages.
    *   Mobile menu: Courses dropdown user-controlled, not auto-open.
3.  **Category System Overhaul (CMS-Driven - Single Source of Truth):**
    *   **Categories:** Dynamically display technology tracks site-wide (initially 8 specific ones were mentioned, but the final implementation moved to fully dynamic from admin).
    *   **Admin Panel:** CRUD operations for categories (add, edit, hide/unhide, delete with auto-unassign), slug uniqueness, course count display, reordering, and **logo URL support**.
    *   **Course Assignment:** Assign one or more categories to any course, with real-time count updates.
    *   **Delete Behavior:** Deleting a category must auto-unassign courses ().
    *   **Frontend Display:** Explore by Category on Homepage (dropdown), Courses dropdown in Header,  page tabs, and  pages must all dynamically fetch data from the database, respect , , , , , . All hardcoded category lists must be removed.
4.  **Lead Capture & PDF Syllabus Downloads.**

Current Implementation: The system now features a 100% dynamic category and course management, addressing all explicit requirements for dynamic content, admin control, and frontend display without hardcoding, fully integrated with a production backend and database. Header branding and mobile menu issues are resolved.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a COMPLETE REWRITE of key frontend components (, , , ) to address persistent issues related to hardcoded categories, synchronization problems between the admin panel and the website's public-facing pages, and general design/functionality inconsistencies.

The current state of the product is:
*   **Fully Dynamic CMS**: All categories and courses are now managed exclusively through the admin panel. There is no hardcoded content.
*   **Admin Panel ()**:
    *   **Categories Tab**: Fully functional with CRUD operations. Users can add new categories, edit existing ones (name, slug, description, , ).
    *   **Course Assignment**: Courses can be assigned to multiple categories via dropdowns, and category deletion auto-unassigns courses.
    *   **Ordering**: Categories can be ordered using a numerical  field, which dictates their display sequence on the website.
    *   **Logo Support**: A  field is available for categories, allowing custom logos to be displayed.
*   **Website Frontend**:
    *   **Header**: The header's Courses dropdown now dynamically displays categories created/managed in the admin panel, including their assigned  and . The original GRRAS branding and navigation behavior are restored.
    *   **Homepage ()**: Categories and courses are displayed dynamically.
    *   **Courses Page ()**: This page now features dynamic category tabs with accurate course counts, filtering courses based on selected categories. The display order of tabs reflects the  set in the admin panel.
*   **Backend & Data**: The frontend is explicitly configured to communicate with the production Railway backend (). The backend provides the content for all dynamic components, ensuring a single source of truth from the production MongoDB.
*   **Stability**: The system now includes robust error handling to prevent white screen issues caused by missing dynamic content, providing fallback mechanisms where necessary (though the final state removed most fallbacks, relying on the CMS).

The system is declared PRODUCTION READY with a clear test flow provided to the user for validation.
