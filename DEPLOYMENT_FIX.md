# Railway Deployment Fix for GRRAS Solutions

## Issue
Railway deployment failing with `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` error due to dependency conflicts.

## Root Cause
- Package.json contained 40+ unused Radix UI dependencies
- Yarn.lock file had conflicts between unused packages
- Docker build process couldn't resolve dependency tree

## Solution Applied

### 1. Cleaned Package.json
- Removed 40+ unused Radix UI packages
- Kept only the 10 Radix components actually used in `/components/ui/`
- Reduced total dependencies from 61 to 25 packages
- Updated Node.js engine requirement to `>=18.0.0` (Railway compatible)

### 2. Key Dependencies Kept
**UI Components (Radix):**
- @radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio
- @radix-ui/react-avatar  
- @radix-ui/react-label
- @radix-ui/react-radio-group
- @radix-ui/react-separator
- @radix-ui/react-slot
- @radix-ui/react-switch
- @radix-ui/react-tabs
- @radix-ui/react-toast
- @radix-ui/react-tooltip

**Core Dependencies:**
- react & react-dom (^18.2.0)
- react-router-dom (^6.21.1) 
- axios (^1.6.5)
- lucide-react (^0.461.0)
- sonner (^1.3.1) - for toast notifications
- tailwindcss & related packages

### 3. Deployment Steps
1. Delete yarn.lock file before committing
2. Let Railway regenerate yarn.lock during build
3. Cleaner dependency tree should resolve build issues

## Verification
After deployment:
- All GRRAS features should work (courses, admin, footer, etc.)
- No missing dependencies
- Faster build times due to fewer packages

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to GitHub
2. Railway will auto-deploy with new package.json
3. Test production site functionality
4. Add missing course data through production admin panel
