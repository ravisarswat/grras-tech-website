# Railway Deployment Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Frontend Build Issue:** `yarn: command not found`
- **Root Cause**: Railway Nixpacks was trying to run `yarn install && yarn build` but yarn wasn't available
- **Solution**: Configured Nixpacks to use npm exclusively with proper Node.js version

### 2. **Backend Build Issue:** `undefined variable 'nodejs-20_x'`
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect nixpacks configuration with invalid Node.js version specification
- **Solution**: Fixed nixpacks.toml with correct Node.js version format

## 📁 **New File Structure:**

```
/app/
├── nixpacks.toml          # Root Nixpacks config (NEW)
├── Procfile               # Railway process config (NEW)
├── railway.toml           # Railway deployment config (NEW)
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (UPDATED)
├── frontend/
│   ├── package.json       # Clean npm-only config (FIXED)
│   ├── railway.toml       # Frontend specific config
│   └── Procfile          # Frontend process config
└── backend/
    ├── server.py         # Updated for Railway (FIXED)
    └── requirements.txt  # Backend dependencies
```

## 🔧 **Key Changes Made:**

### **Root Configuration (nixpacks.toml):**
```toml
[variables]
NODE_VERSION = "20"
NPM_VERSION = "9"

[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "python39"]

[phases.build]
cmds = [
    "cd frontend && npm ci --only=production",
    "cd frontend && npm run build", 
    "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"
]

[start]
cmd = "python backend/server.py"
```

### **Frontend Package.json:**
- Removed all yarn references
- Added `serve` package for production
- Set proper Node.js engine versions
- NPM-only scripts

### **Backend Server.py:**
- Configured for Railway PORT environment variable
- Proper CORS setup for Railway deployment
- MongoDB Atlas connection with environment variable priority

### **Process Configuration:**
- `Procfile`: Defines how Railway starts the backend
- `railway.toml`: Railway-specific deployment settings

## ✅ **Expected Results:**

1. **Frontend Build**: `npm ci && npm run build` will succeed
2. **Backend Setup**: Python dependencies will install correctly
3. **Service Start**: Backend will start on Railway PORT
4. **Database**: Will connect to MongoDB using MONGO_URI from GitHub environment

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - complete npm/python setup"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 3. Railway will auto-deploy both services
```

## 📊 **Verification:**

After deployment succeeds:
- Frontend: Static React app served by `serve` package
- Backend: FastAPI running on Railway assigned PORT
- API: Available at `your-railway-url.app/api/health`
- Website: Fully functional at `your-railway-url.app`

## 🔄 **Next Steps After Deployment:**

1. Test the deployed site functionality
2. Add missing course data via production admin panel
3. Verify footer improvements are visible
4. Test all new features (eligibility widget, etc.)

## 🆘 **If Issues Persist:**

The configuration is now correct for Railway's Nixpacks builder. If deployment still fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify environment variables (MONGO_URI) are set in Railway dashboard
3. Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows connections from Railway IP ranges
