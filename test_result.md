   - Cyber Security course
   - Remove or update test courses with proper eligibility criteria

### Data Quality Improvements:
1. **Standardize eligibility format** across all courses
2. **Remove duplicate test courses** from production database
3. **Implement data validation** for required fields in CMS

### System Health:
- ✅ Backend server is fully operational
- ✅ All core APIs are working correctly
- ✅ MongoDB integration is stable
- ✅ EligibilityWidget will work for properly configured courses

## Conclusion

The backend system is **HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL** with excellent performance and stability. The FastAPI server, MongoDB connection, and all major API endpoints are working correctly. The EligibilityWidget data issue is a **minor data quality problem** that affects only test courses and one production course, not a system-level failure.

**Backend Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
**EligibilityWidget Compatibility**: ⚠️ NEEDS MINOR DATA FIXES
**Overall Assessment**: EXCELLENT - Backend fully supports the EligibilityWidget functionality for properly configured courses.
