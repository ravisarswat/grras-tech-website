#### üîß Frontend Investigation Required:
1. **Verify Frontend API Calls**: Check if frontend is correctly calling /api/content
2. **Check Data Path Access**: Ensure frontend accesses `content.learningPaths` correctly
3. **Component State Debug**: Verify learning paths components are receiving data
4. **Console Logging**: Add frontend logging to trace data flow from API to components

### üéØ CONCLUSION

**Learning Paths Backend Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND READY**

The backend Learning Paths functionality is working perfectly with:
- Complete data structure with 3 comprehensive learning paths
- Proper content migration and data population
- Featured paths configuration working correctly
- All required fields present for frontend display
- Excellent API performance and data accessibility

**Issue Location**: The empty content issue is **NOT in the backend** - it's a frontend integration or component issue. The backend is providing all required learning paths data correctly.

2. **All Learning Paths Added**: ‚úÖ 3 new learning paths successfully implemented
3. **Data Quality**: ‚úÖ All new content has complete data structure
4. **API Access**: ‚úÖ All content accessible via preview environment API
5. **Admin Management**: ‚úÖ Content manageable via admin authentication

#### üö® CRITICAL: Production Backend Deployment Required
1. **Deploy Backend API to Production**: The FastAPI backend needs to be deployed to https://www.grras.tech
2. **Configure API Endpoints**: Ensure /api/* routes are properly configured in production
3. **Database Connection**: Verify MongoDB connection in production environment
4. **Content Migration**: Migrate content from preview to production once backend is deployed

#### üîß Minor Data Quality Improvements (Optional):
1. **Clean Legacy Test Courses**: Remove or update test courses with proper eligibility criteria
2. **Standardize Eligibility Format**: Ensure consistent eligibility format across all courses
