#### üîß Frontend Investigation Required:
1. **Verify Frontend API Calls**: Check if frontend is correctly calling /api/content
2. **Check Data Path Access**: Ensure frontend accesses `content.learningPaths` correctly
3. **Component State Debug**: Verify learning paths components are receiving data
4. **Console Logging**: Add frontend logging to trace data flow from API to components

### üéØ CONCLUSION

**Learning Paths Backend Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND READY**

The backend Learning Paths functionality is working perfectly with:
- Complete data structure with 3 comprehensive learning paths
- Proper content migration and data population
- Featured paths configuration working correctly
