3. **CMS Content**: ✅ Working - GET /api/content returns full CMS data
4. **Admin Authentication**: ✅ Working - POST /api/admin/login with "grras-admin" succeeds

**Critical Issue Identified:**
The new certification courses (AWS, Kubernetes, Red Hat) are **MISSING from the production backend database**. Only RHCSA exists, while 6 other certification courses need to be migrated from preview to production environment.

**Next Steps:**
1. Use admin authentication to add missing certification courses to production
2. Migrate content from preview environment to production database
3. Verify all 7 certification courses are available in production after migration
